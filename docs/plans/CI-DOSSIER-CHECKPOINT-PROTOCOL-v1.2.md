# CI Dossier Checkpoint Protocol v1.2

**Status:** MANDATORY — no dossier is complete until every checkpoint is ticked with verified evidence.
**Version:** 1.2 (v1.0 baseline + v1.1 Google Workspace/Stitch/Banana Pro + v1.2 GitHub secret discoveries)
**Checkpoints:** 196 total (173 v1.0 + 17 v1.1 + 6 v1.2)
**Scope:** Every competitor in the 11-competitor fan-out (PropZone, Dono.AI, PropertyOnion, Algoma, Gridics, Zoneomics, TestFit, Autodesk Forma, Reonomy, RealtyMole/ATTOM, AI Topia).
**Owner:** AI Architect executing per competitor.
**Rule:** No execution of the next phase until all checkpoints in the current phase are green. No deliverable is produced until all 12 phases are green and EG14 gate passes.

## Version History

| Version | Checkpoints | Trigger | Status |
|---------|-------------|---------|--------|
| v1.0    | 173         | Initial baseline | ✅ COMMITTED |
| v1.1    | 190 (+17)   | Google Workspace Business + Stitch + Banana Pro | ✅ MERGED |
| v1.2    | 196 (+6)    | GitHub secret mining: Exa + LinkedIn auth + BuiltWith + Apify + Greptile | ✅ MERGED |

---

## Checkpoint Format

Each checkpoint requires **three things** before it can be ticked:
1. **Artifact** — the concrete file / row / screenshot / JSON that was produced
2. **Evidence path** — where it's persisted (Supabase table + row ID, or bucket path)
3. **Verification command** — the shell command or SQL query that proves it exists

A checkpoint without all three is not ticked. No exceptions.

---

## Phase Gate Rules (MANDATORY)

1. **No phase starts until the prior phase is 100% green.** No exceptions.
2. **No checkpoint is ticked without all three: artifact, evidence path, verification command.**
3. **No deliverable is produced before Phase 10 EG14 gate returns verdict='pass'.**
4. **No shortcuts via in-memory reasoning.** All deliverables regenerated from SQL queries in Phase 11.
5. **If a tool fails, fix the tool or document why it can't be used — do not route around silently.**
6. **Honesty protocol applies:** VERIFIED / UNTESTED / INFERRED labels on every finding.
7. **Ghost-success detection:** if a checkpoint looks passed but the verification command would fail, it's NOT passed.
8. **Regression-fix loop max: 3 attempts per phase.** After 3, escalate to human.

## Checkpoint Compliance Commitment

This protocol supersedes any prior informal execution. The AI Architect commits:
- Every checkpoint will be ticked only with verified evidence
- No deliverable will be produced that references evidence not in ci-evidence bucket
- No phase will be skipped to save time
- Ghost-success patterns (claiming done without verification) are forbidden
- Regression-fix loops will run before escalation to human

**Version:** 1.2
**Date:** April 10, 2026
**Authority:** Approved by Ariel Shapira per SUMMIT #445
**Changelog:**
- v1.0 → v1.1: +17 checkpoints (Google Workspace Business + Stitch + Banana Pro)
- v1.1 → v1.2: +6 checkpoints (Exa, LinkedIn auth, Apify, Greptile, BuiltWith)
